## Welcome to the Truth Psychiatric Trauma Ward

### what dis
- Once in a blue moon, someone goes out of their way to fuck with me in a spectacularly deliberate manner. However no normal venue wants to deal with "drama" (actual people's lives), and they'll insist you go to mythical "other places for that" to defend yourself and speak the truth. This is that venue for me, and for you too should you fuck up real real bad with me.
- Patient PHI is always anonymized.
- Patient prognosis is not the responsibility of the ward. The Truth Ward offers only intake and noninvasive screening services.
- Once the patient has issued a sincere public confession AND apology to ALL affected parties, they are free to exit the patient portal.

### patient portal
- The Jeffersons, my blood relatives who neglected their lovely family to become eternally mad at pop politics until the sweet release of death takes them.
- Sarah Wiggum-Vance-Jefferson-Smalls-Wiggum, graphic designer with an infidelity+gaslighting streak across at least 3 consecutive relationships.
- Sammy Smalls, software engineer who smothered me with details of his divorce and implicated me as an accessory to wiretapping, both in explicit violation of my consent.
- [Patrick Jordan](https://github.com/aquacluck/truth/tree/main/patient-0003), young speedrunning savant who turned to brazen manipulation+deceit once he was told he's not owed an explanation for every ban he incurs.

### isnt this kinda mean?
- yeah :( but I'm not really looking for reach/engagement, just the documentation+accountability our current social institutions rob us of. And again this isn't a place for minor annoyances -- all patients have shamelessly + personally + deliberately wronged me.
- these people could just apologize at any time lmao, see above for details. But none of them would, or it would be some fake bullshit, by the time they make it here. And that's exactly why they're here, I'm not *that* hard to get along with, some people just can't help themselves but start shit.

### and isnt this pretty weird?
- most definitely, but sometimes drastic measures are appropriate
- uhhh it could get a whole lot weirder? I'm happy to say my peace here and move on with life. It's pretty tame really. Get over your bullshit.
- creative writing is fun. you're weird.

### legal
- All material is free for reuse under the terms of [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
- Free speech is under attack worldwide as governments naively struggle against the incredible power of the internet to connect us, inform us, and misinform us. Citizens who work to resist censorship likewise grapple against the inevitability that they enable actors working in bad faith. This is one of many crises facing the world today, and I'm thankful that America grants me reasonable freedom to speak my mind without fear of legal retaliation from any party. Many nations do not enjoy this level of freedom in this area, and despite America's many troubles I'm proud to celebrate this with you today. GOD BLESS AMERICA! GOD BLESS "OLD GLORY" AND THE OMNISCIENT CHICKENHEAD TRUTH TEMPLE FOR WHICH SHE STANDS
